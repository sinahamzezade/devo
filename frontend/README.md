## Implementation Details

### Dynamic Form Rendering

Forms are entirely dynamic, with the structure fetched from the API. Each form:

- Supports conditional fields that appear/disappear based on user input
- Validates input data in real-time
- Can have nested sections and fields
- Dynamically fetches options from APIs for select fields

### Customizable List View

The submissions list provides:

- Column selection for customizing the view
- Sorting by any column
- Filtering by multiple criteria
- Full-text search across all fields
- Pagination for handling large datasets
